It utilizes a dataset called State Fragility that provides index scores for countries in two key categories: Effectiveness and Legitimacy. These categories are further divided into four dimensions: Security, Political, Economic, and Social Effectiveness/Legitimacy. The index score is determined by combining the effectiveness score and the legitimacy score of each country.",
